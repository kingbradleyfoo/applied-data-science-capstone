# Applied Data Science Capstone

This capstone project is working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX and, in the process, follows the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualisation, model development, model evaluation, and reporting results to stakeholders.   

This tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, costing 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each; much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 

Therefore, if this can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of the Data Science findings and models, the competing startup hired can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
